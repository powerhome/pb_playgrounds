# Playgrounds

Playgrounds is a standard webpacker rails environment that is intended for Playbook UI Kits, and building Nitro prototypes.

# Prerequisites

#### Node version manager (NVM)

This utility is used throughout Nitro to keep us all at the same version of `node` and prevent chaos. [NVM Installation Instructions on Github](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script).

<details><summary>NVM for ZSH Users</summary>
<p>

#### ZSH Users: Add this code block somewhere in your `~/.zshrc`

```sh
# NVM
autoload -U add-zsh-hook
load-nvmrc() {
  if [[ -f .nvmrc && -r .nvmrc ]]; then
    nvm use
  fi
}
add-zsh-hook chpwd load-nvmrc
```
</p>

#### Other Features

<details><summary>Enable Webpack HMR (Hot Module Reloading)</summary>
  <p>

  #### Webpack HMR

  Webpack Hot Module Reloading (HMR) is enabled in `Playgrounds` which allows you to make changes to a React component and immediately see the changes you made in your browser *without needing to refresh!*

  Here's how to get that feature working:

  1. in a new tab, from the current `playgrounds` working directory root:

      - `yarn hmr` - this starts the HMR server which will actively watch, compile and deliver updates to your browser just by saving changes.

  <summary>Working with a Local Version of Playbook</summary>

  #### Working with a Local Version of Playbook in React


  Another available feature is the ability to work with your current locally cloned `Playbook` repository. To enable this you will need to follow these steps:

  1. Change directories to your local `playbook-ui` repo instance.
  2. Run `yarn link` - this will create a symlink to this repository that you will use in the last step
  3. Change directories to your local `playgrounds` repo instance.
  4. Run `yarn link playbook-ui` - this completes the linking to the symlink that you created in step #2 above.

  Now you can simply run HMR in `Playgrounds` and make changes to your `Playbook` repo all while seeing the changes propagate instantly in your browser!

<details><summary>Build only</summary>
<p>

`yarn build` - this will compile (only once) and will not deliver updates automatically to your browser on save.

# New Prototypes

Mostly `Playgrounds` is used to build Nitro prototypes. These prototype branches will never be merged into master. Prototype pull requests are for team review only.

#### New prototype branch

```bash
# Always start from master
git checkout origin master
```

```bash
# pull latest master branch locally
git pull origin master
```

```bash
# create a new prototype branch
git checkout -b demo/my-prototype-name
```

```bash
# push new prototype up to start a pull request for team review
git push origin demo/my-prototype-name
```

<details><summary>Adding new pages</summary>
<p>

## Adding New Pages (Routes)
When you start the server, the root page is [index.html.erb](https://github.com/powerhome/playgrounds/blob/master/app/views/pages/index.html.erb).

If you have a multi-page prototype, you will want to add additional pages.  Please follow the guide below:

### 1. Create the new page
Create a new file in `app/views/pages/my_new_page.html.erb`.

Please note:
1. The file extension ends in `.html.erb`. This is required.
2. If the file is describing a page in multiple words (my new page), and it should be written with underscores.
3. The file name should be all lowercase.

---

### 2. Add to controller
```ruby
# app/controllers/pages_controller.rb

class PagesController < ApplicationController
  def index; end
  def my_new_page; end
end
```

Please note:
1. The def is named exactly like the html.erb file created above.

---

### 3. Create a new route
```ruby
# config/routes.rb

Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get "my-new-page-custom", to: "pages#my_new_page"
  root 'pages#index'
end
```

Please note:
1. `my-new-page-custom` can be anything, and does not have to related the the name defined in html or controller. This text is in the url, example http://localhost:3000/my-new-page-custom.
2. `pages#my_new_page` the value after #, must be identical to what you added to the pages controller above.

  ## Using Playbook Kits

  ### Confirm styles are imported
  ```scss
  // app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss

  @import "playbook";
  ```

  ### Use kits in views
  ```erb
  # Use kits in your prototype views

  <%= pb_rails("card") do %>
    <%= pb_rails("caption", props: {text: "This is a caption"}) %>
  <% end %>
  ```

# Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary>Yarn packages are out of date</summary>

  ## Yarn packages are out of date
If you try running playgrounds by `rails s`, but the terminal says:

```bash
========================================
  Your Yarn packages are out of date!
  Please run `yarn install --check-files` to update.
========================================
```

#### Try the following:
```bash
# Use the correct version of node required by the project
nvm use 8.9.4
```

```bash
# Run yarn install
yarn install --check-files
```

```bash
# Try running your rails server again
rails s
```
